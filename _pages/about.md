Welcome! I'm Shuchen Wang and graduated from [Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health](http://www.sinh.cas.cn/), [University of Chinese Academic and Science](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) in Jan 2024. My research agenda focuses on early life nutrition and offspring health, expecially breast milk nutrients and infant neurocognitive development. My research interests include pregnancy health, maternal dietary factors, genetics and offspring health, such as cardiometabolic health and cognitive function change across the life span.
